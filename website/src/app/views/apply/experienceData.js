    experience: '"A technical challenge I had working on the iOS app was understanding nested views and using those with a tab bar. For example, if you click through to peopleâ€™s profiles, then their posts, then their profiles from the main feed, you would get three different navigation bars stacked on top of each other. Eventually, I was able to successfully display only one navigation bar at a time by adjusting the locations of where the views were created."',

CCL has not been able to host in-person workshops over the past year, resulting in students missing out on the hands-on learning experience that CCL offers. However, giving them access to these workshops online in the form of interactive lessons has allowed them to learn and explore STEAM topics at home!"',

Overall, I can confidently say that everyone got a good understanding of working in a startup-like environment while learning about key tools/workflows to become a software engineer."',
