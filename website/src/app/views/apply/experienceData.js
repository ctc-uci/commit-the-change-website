    experience: '"This is the first iOS app that I have helped develop. Mobile development presents many unique challenges, like displaying content through "views" or reducing the app\'s operating time. Overall, this project has strengthened my problem-solving skills and helped me explore a new branch of computer science."',

    experience: '"I joined CTC because I was looking for a community of students that are passionate about combining tech and community service, which is exactly what I found! Since it was first formed, CTC has been a close-knit group of driven students who are always willing to help and mentor each other. We come together to support and advocate for nonprofit organizations, and we have learned so much about our community in the process. The members of CTC board have been such an amazing support system and have helped me feel connected to the student body at UCI, especially while learning remotely and living at home. I\'m so grateful that I get to be part of this group of creative, hardworking, inspiring students, thanks to CTC!"',

    experience: '"At the beginning of fall quarter, I did not know the difference between frontend and backend development. At the end of the college year, I learned how to create a frontend UI that sends API requests to a backend server to query a database. Don’t worry if you did not understand that, I was in the same boat last year. Overall, I can confidently say that everyone got a good understanding of working in a startup-like environment while learning about key tools/workflows to become a better software engineer."',

There was constantly something new coming my way, but thanks to my amazing and supportive teammates, I was always able to keep up. I learned basic things, from the difference between front end and backend, to more complex things, like how to understand and write REST API."',

We spent a lot of time discussing and clarifying tasks, refactoring code, and giving feedback on each other’s work.
