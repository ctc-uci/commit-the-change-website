      answer:
        'We look for passionate, committed UC Irvine students who are interested in learning new technical skills by working on projects for non-profit organizations with other like-minded peers. Ideally, students would be in an ICS or related major, but if not, they are expected to have skills to back themselves up. There are no specific technical experience requirements, but it definitely helps to have something that demonstrates your initiative to learn and be involved! Our applications for the 2021-2022 school year are now CLOSED. We do not have any plans for future recruitment throughout the school year, but please follow us on our social medias for any updates! Thanks for your interest.',

      question:
        'I’m not sure if I should join because I haven’t had any internships or lots of experience.',
      answer:
        'Don’t worry, there is no required internship or experience level qualification! Here at Commit the Change, we know what it’s like to think, “I don’t know if I can do this,” and that’s why we started this club, to help you act on your growth mindset. Like we stated already, we are looking for students who want to continuously learn/grow and always get back up after failing.',

      question:
        'If I am accepted to join Commit the Change, how will we be matched to a project and how long is the commitment for?',
      answer:
        "Once accepted into Commit the Change, each member will fill out a preference form to be matched to a specific project. We've scoped out our projects to be a year long commitment with NPOs and one of our primary goals is to bring you through the entire development cycle from the initial prototyping all the way to the finished product. Therefore, you must be able to commit yourself to the club from October 2021 to June 2022, dedicating about 4 to 6 hours a week to meetings, project work, and other club events.",

      answer:
        'As a designer, you’ll learn about the UI/UX Design process (wireframing, creating low to high fidelity mockups, branding, and more). You’ll also learn about incorporating user research when applicable and writing case studies after the entire design process is finished! As a designer, you’ll also get to learn about working in a cross-functional team. We’ll be primarily using Figma and other tools like Miro.',

      question: 'What will I learn as a developer?',

You will also learn about version control (Git), doing code reviews for your fellow team members, and other industry best practices that will ensure you are able to write high-quality, sustainable code.",
