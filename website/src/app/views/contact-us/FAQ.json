    "question": "Who can join Commit the Change and work on the projects?",
    "answer": "We are looking for passionate, committed, UC Irvine students with an interest in learning new technical skills by working on projects for non-profit organizations with other like-minded peers. Ideally, students would be in an ICS or related major, but if not, they are expected to have skills to back themselves up. There are no specific technical experience requirements, but it definitely helps to have something that demonstrates your initiative to learn and be involved! We're currently seeking Designers and Developers for the upcoming school year, so if this sounds like you, don't hesitate to apply!"

    "question": "How do I join a Commit the Change project team?",
    "answer": "Fill out our application, due on Oct. 10th! It's a simple Google form and a chance to pitch yourself to our organization. Some things we ask about are your level of experience, your reasons for applying, and more information about you, your studies, and your interests. Once all the applications are in, the Recruitment committee will reach out to you to schedule a coffee chat — not an interview, but a way for us to meet each other and to get to know you better. After that, we'll take some time to make our final decisions. While we would like to accept everyone who is interested, we have limited space on our project teams. Decisions will be sent out to everyone by Oct. 18th."

    "question": "I’m not sure if I should join because I haven’t had any internships or lots of experience.",
    "answer": "Don’t worry, there is no required internship or experience level qualification! Here at Commit the Change, we know what it’s like to think, “I don’t know if I can do this,” and that’s why we started this club, to help you act on your growth mindset. Like we stated already, we are looking for students who want to continuously learn/grow and always get back up after failing."
